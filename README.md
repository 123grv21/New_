Python Basic Logic Programs

This repository contains two simple Python programs written to practice core programming logic.
The focus is on understanding conditions, loops, and basic input/output handling.

1️⃣ Even or Odd Number Checker

This program takes an integer input from the user and determines whether the number is even or odd.
It uses the modulus (%) operator to check divisibility by 2.
The program demonstrates basic conditional statements (if-else).
It helps beginners understand decision-making logic in Python.

2️⃣ Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50

This program calculates the sum of integers from 1 to 50.
It uses a for loop and an accumulator variable to store the running total.
The program demonstrates loop control and arithmetic operations.
It helps in understanding iteration and cumulative logic.
